.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The purpose of this program is to provide a daemonized version of the
spamassassin executable.  The goal is improving throughput performance for
automated mail checking.
.PP
This is intended to be used alongside \f(CW\*(C`spamc\*(C'\fR, a fast, low-overhead C client
program.
.PP
See the \s-1README\s0 file in the \f(CW\*(C`spamd\*(C'\fR directory of the SpamAssassin distribution
for more details.
.PP
Note: Although \f(CW\*(C`spamd\*(C'\fR will check per-user config files for every message, any
changes to the system-wide config files will require either restarting spamd
or forcing it to reload itself via \fB\s-1SIGHUP\s0\fR for the changes to take effect.
.PP
Note: If \f(CW\*(C`spamd\*(C'\fR receives a \fB\s-1SIGHUP\s0\fR, it internally reloads itself, which
means that it will change its pid and might not restart at all if its
environment changed  (ie. if it can't change back into its own directory).  If
you plan to use \fB\s-1SIGHUP\s0\fR, you should always start \f(CW\*(C`spamd\*(C'\fR with the \fB\-r\fR
switch to know its current pid.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Options of the long form can be shortened as long as they remain
unambiguous.  (i.e. \fB\-\-dae\fR can be used instead of \fB\-\-daemonize\fR)
Also, boolean options (like \fB\-\-user\-config\fR) can be negated by
adding \fIno\fR (\fB\-\-nouser\-config\fR), however, this is usually unnecessary.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-allow\-tell\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --allow-tell"
Allow learning and forgetting (to a local Bayes database), reporting
and revoking (to a remote database) by spamd. The client issues a \s-1TELL\s0
command to tell what type of message is being processed and whether
local (learn/forget) or remote (report/revoke) databases should be
updated.
.Sp
Note that spamd always trusts the username passed in (unless
\&\fB\-\-auth\-ident\fR is used) so clients could maliciously learn messages
for other users. (This is not ususally a concern with an \s-1SQL\s0 Bayes
store as users will typically have read-write access directly to the
database, and can also use \f(CW\*(C`sa\-learn\*(C'\fR with the \fB\-u\fR option to
achieve the same result.)
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-create\-prefs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --create-prefs"
Create user preferences files if they don't exist (default: don't).
.IP "\fB\-C\fR \fIpath\fR, \fB\-\-configpath\fR=\fIpath\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C path, --configpath=path"
Use the specified path for locating the distributed configuration files.
Ignore the default directories (usually \f(CW\*(C`/usr/share/spamassassin\*(C'\fR or similar).
.IP "\fB\-\-siteconfigpath\fR=\fIpath\fR" 4
.IX Item "--siteconfigpath=path"
Use the specified path for locating site-specific configuration files.  Ignore
the default directories (usually \f(CW\*(C`/etc/mail/spamassassin\*(C'\fR or similar).
.IP "\fB\-\-cf='config line'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--cf='config line'"
Add additional lines of configuration directly from the command-line, parsed
after the configuration files are read.   Multiple \fB\-\-cf\fR arguments can be
used, and each will be considered a separate line of configuration.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-daemonize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d, --daemonize"
Detach from starting process and run in background (daemonize).
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Print a brief help message, then exit without further action.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V, --version"
Print version information, then exit without further action.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR [\fIipaddress\fR], \fB\-\-listen\-ip\fR[=\fIipaddress\fR], \fB\-\-ip\-address\fR[=\fIipaddress\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-i [ipaddress], --listen-ip[=ipaddress], --ip-address[=ipaddress]"
Tells spamd to listen on the specified \s-1IP\s0 address (defaults to 127.0.0.1).  If
you specify no \s-1IP\s0 address after the switch, spamd will listen on all interfaces.
(This is equal to the address 0.0.0.0).  You can also use a valid hostname which
will make spamd listen on the first address that name resolves to.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR \fIport\fR, \fB\-\-port\fR=\fIport\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p port, --port=port"
Optionally specifies the port number for the server to listen on (default: 783).
.Sp
If the \fB\-\-ssl\fR switch is used, and \fB\-\-ssl\-port\fR is not supplied, then this
port will be used to accept \s-1SSL\s0 connections instead of unencrypted connections.
If the \fB\-\-ssl\fR switch is used, and \fB\-\-ssl\-port\fR is set, then unencrypted
connections will be accepted on the \fB\-\-port\fR at the same time as encrypted
connections are accepted at \fB\-\-ssl\-port\fR.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-sql\-config\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q, --sql-config"
Turn on \s-1SQL\s0 lookups even when per-user config files have been disabled
with \fB\-x\fR. this is useful for spamd hosts which don't have user's
home directories but do want to load user preferences from an \s-1SQL\s0
database.
.Sp
If your spamc client does not support sending the \f(CW\*(C`User:\*(C'\fR header,
like \f(CW\*(C`exiscan\*(C'\fR, then the \s-1SQL\s0 username used will always be \fBnobody\fR.
.Sp
This inhibits the \fIsetuid()\fR behavior, so the \f(CW\*(C`\-u\*(C'\fR option is
required. If you want the \fIsetuid()\fR behaviour, use \f(CW\*(C`\-Q\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-setuid\-with\-sql\*(C'\fR instead.
.IP "\fB\-\-ldap\-config\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ldap-config"
Turn on \s-1LDAP\s0 lookups. This is completely analog to \f(CW\*(C`\-\-sql\-config\*(C'\fR,
only it is using an \s-1LDAP\s0 server.
.Sp
Like \f(CW\*(C`\-\-sql\-config\*(C'\fR, this disables the setuid behavior, and requires
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-u\*(C'\fR. If you want it, use \f(CW\*(C`\-\-setuid\-with\-ldap\*(C'\fR instead.
.IP "\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-setuid\-with\-sql\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Q, --setuid-with-sql"
Turn on \s-1SQL\s0 lookups even when per-user config files have been disabled
with \fB\-x\fR and also setuid to the user.  This is useful for spamd hosts
which want to load user preferences from an \s-1SQL\s0 database but also wish to
support the use of \fB\-H\fR (Helper home directories.)
.IP "\fB\-\-setuid\-with\-ldap\fR" 4
.IX Item "--setuid-with-ldap"
Turn on \s-1LDAP\s0 lookups even when per-user config files have been disabled
with \fB\-x\fR and also setuid to the user.  This is again completely analog
to \f(CW\*(C`\-\-setuid\-with\-sql\*(C'\fR, only it is using an \s-1LDAP\s0 server.
.IP "\fB\-\-virtual\-config\-dir\fR=\fIpattern\fR" 4
.IX Item "--virtual-config-dir=pattern"
This option specifies where per-user preferences can be found for virtual
users, for the \fB\-x\fR switch. The \fIpattern\fR is used as a base pattern for the
directory name.  Any of the following escapes can be used:
.RS 4
.ie n .IP "%u \*(-- replaced with the full name of the current user, as sent by spamc." 4
.el .IP "\f(CW%u\fR \*(-- replaced with the full name of the current user, as sent by spamc." 4
.IX Item "%u replaced with the full name of the current user, as sent by spamc."
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "%l \*(-- replaced with the 'local part' of the current username.  In other words, if the username is an email address, this is the part before the ""@"" sign." 4
.el .IP "\f(CW%l\fR \*(-- replaced with the 'local part' of the current username.  In other words, if the username is an email address, this is the part before the \f(CW@\fR sign." 4
.IX Item "%l replaced with the 'local part' of the current username. In other words, if the username is an email address, this is the part before the @ sign."
.ie n .IP "%d \*(-- replaced with the 'domain' of the current username.  In other words, if the username is an email address, this is the part after the ""@"" sign." 4
.el .IP "\f(CW%d\fR \*(-- replaced with the 'domain' of the current username.  In other words, if the username is an email address, this is the part after the \f(CW@\fR sign." 4
.IX Item "%d replaced with the 'domain' of the current username. In other words, if the username is an email address, this is the part after the @ sign."
.IP "%% \*(-- replaced with a single percent sign (%)." 4
.IX Item "%% replaced with a single percent sign (%)."
.RE
.RS 4
.PD
.Sp
So for example, if \f(CW\*(C`/vhome/users/%u/spamassassin\*(C'\fR is specified, and spamc
sends a virtual username of \f(CW\*(C`jm@example.com\*(C'\fR, the directory
\&\f(CW\*(C`/vhome/users/jm@example.com/spamassassin\*(C'\fR will be used.
.Sp
The set of characters allowed in the virtual username for this path are
restricted to:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        A\-Z a\-z 0\-9 \- + _ . , @ =
.Ve
.Sp
All others will be replaced by underscores (\f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
This path must be a writable directory.  It will be created if it does not
already exist.  If a file called \fBuser_prefs\fR exists in this directory (note:
\&\fBnot\fR in a \f(CW\*(C`.spamassassin\*(C'\fR subdirectory!), it will be loaded as the user's
preferences.  The Bayes databases for that user will be stored in this directory.
.Sp
Note that this \fBrequires\fR that \fB\-x\fR is used, and cannot be combined with
\&\s-1SQL\-\s0 or LDAP-based configuration.
.Sp
The pattern \fBmust\fR expand to an absolute directory when spamd is running
daemonized (\fB\-d\fR).
.Sp
Currently, use of this without \fB\-u\fR is not supported. This inhibits setuid.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-r\fR \fIpidfile\fR, \fB\-\-pidfile\fR=\fIpidfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r pidfile, --pidfile=pidfile"
Write the process \s-1ID\s0 of the spamd parent to the file specified by \fIpidfile\fR.
The file will be unlinked when the parent exits.  Note that when running
with the \fB\-u\fR option, the file must be writable by that user.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-vpopmail\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v, --vpopmail"
Enable vpopmail config.  If specified with with \fB\-u\fR set to the vpopmail user,
this allows spamd to lookup/create user_prefs in the vpopmail user's own
maildir.  This option is useful for vpopmail virtual users who do not have an
entry in the system /etc/passwd file.
.Sp
Currently, use of this without \fB\-u\fR is not supported. This inhibits setuid.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR \fIfacility\fR, \fB\-\-syslog\fR=\fIfacility\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s facility, --syslog=facility"
Specify the syslog facility to use (default: mail).  If \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR is specified,
output will be written to stderr. (This is useful if you're running \f(CW\*(C`spamd\*(C'\fR
under the \f(CW\*(C`daemontools\*(C'\fR package.) With a \fIfacility\fR of \f(CW\*(C`file\*(C'\fR, all output
goes to spamd.log. \fIfacility\fR is interpreted as a file name to log to if it
contains any characters except a\-z and 0\-9. \f(CW\*(C`null\*(C'\fR disables logging completely
(used internally).
.Sp
Examples:
	spamd \-s mail                 # use syslog, facility mail (default)
	spamd \-s ./mail               # log to file ./mail
	spamd \-s stderr 2>/dev/null   # log to stderr, throw messages away
	spamd \-s null                 # the same as above
	spamd \-s file                 # log to file ./spamd.log
	spamd \-s /var/log/spamd.log   # log to file /var/log/spamd.log
.Sp
If logging to a file is enabled and that log file is rotated, the spamd server
must be restarted with a \s-1SIGHUP. \s0(If the log file is just truncated, this is
not needed but still recommended.)
.Sp
Note that logging to a file does not use locking, so you cannot intermix
logging from spamd and other processes into the same file.  If you want
to mix logging like this, use syslog instead.
.Sp
If you use syslog logging, it is essential to send a \s-1SIGHUP\s0 to the spamd daemon
when you restart the syslogd daemon.  (This is due to a shortcoming in Perl's
syslog handling, where the disappearance of the connection to the syslogd is
considered a fatal error.)
.IP "\fB\-\-syslog\-socket\fR=\fItype\fR" 4
.IX Item "--syslog-socket=type"
Specify how spamd should send messages to syslogd. The \fItype\fR can be any
of the socket types or logging mechanisms as accepted by the subroutine
\&\fISys::Syslog::setlogsock()\fR. Depending on a version of Sys::Syslog and on the
underlying operating system, one of the following values (or their subset) can
be used: \f(CW\*(C`native\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`eventlog\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`tcp\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`udp\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`inet\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`unix\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`stream\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`pipe\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`console\*(C'\fR.  The value \f(CW\*(C`eventlog\*(C'\fR is specific to Win32 events
logger and requires a perl module Win32::EventLog to be installed.
For more information please consult the Sys::Syslog documentation.
.Sp
A historical setting \-\-syslog\-socket=none is mapped to \-\-syslog=stderr.
.Sp
A default for Windows platforms is \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, otherwise the default is
to try \f(CW\*(C`unix\*(C'\fR first, falling back to \f(CW\*(C`inet\*(C'\fR if perl detects errors
in its \f(CW\*(C`unix\*(C'\fR support.
.Sp
Some platforms, or versions of perl, are shipped with old or dysfunctional
versions of the \fBSys::Syslog\fR module which do not support some socket types,
so you may need to set this option explicitly.  If you get error messages
regarding \fB_\|_PATH_LOG\fR or similar spamd, try changing this setting.
.Sp
The socket types \f(CW\*(C`file\*(C'\fR is used internally and should not be specified.
Use the \f(CW\*(C`\-s\*(C'\fR switch instead.
.IP "\fB\-\-log\-timestamp\-fmt\fR=\fIformat\fR" 4
.IX Item "--log-timestamp-fmt=format"
The \-\-log\-timestamp\-fmt option can provide a \s-1POSIX\s0 \fIstrftime\fR\|(3) format for
timestamps included in each logged message. Each logger (stderr, file,
syslog) has its own default value for a timestamp format, which applies when
\&\-\-log\-timestamp\-fmt option is not given, or with \-\-log\-timestamp\-fmt=default .
Timestamps can be turned off by specifying an empty string with this
option, e.g. \-\-log\-timestamp\-fmt='' or just \-\-log\-timestamp\-fmt= .
Typical use: \-\-log\-timestamp\-fmt='%a \f(CW%b\fR \f(CW%e\fR \f(CW%H:\fR%M:%S \f(CW%Y\fR' (provides
localized weekday and month names in the \fIctime\fR\|(3) style),
or '%a, \f(CW%e\fR \f(CW%b\fR \f(CW%Y\fR \f(CW%H:\fR%M:%S \f(CW%z\fR (%Z)' for a \s-1RFC 2822\s0 format,
or maybe '%Y\-%m\-%d \f(CW%H:\fR%M:%S%z' for an \s-1ISO 8601 \s0(\s-1EN 28601\s0) format,
or just '%Y%m%dT%H%M%S' .
.IP "\fB\-u\fR \fIusername\fR, \fB\-\-username\fR=\fIusername\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u username, --username=username"
Run as the named user.  If this option is not set, the default behaviour
is to \fIsetuid()\fR to the user running \f(CW\*(C`spamc\*(C'\fR, if \f(CW\*(C`spamd\*(C'\fR is running
as root.
.Sp
Note: \*(L"\-\-username=root\*(R" is not a valid option.  If specified, \f(CW\*(C`spamd\*(C'\fR will
exit with a fatal error on startup.
.IP "\fB\-g\fR \fIgroupname\fR, \fB\-\-groupname\fR=\fIgroupname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g groupname, --groupname=groupname"
Run as the named group if \-\-username is being used. If this option is
not set when \-\-username is used then the primary group for the user
given to \-\-username is used.
.IP "\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-nouser\-config\fR, \fB\-\-user\-config\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x, --nouser-config, --user-config"
Turn off (on) reading of per-user configuration files (user_prefs) from the
user's home directory.  The default behaviour is to read per-user
configuration from the user's home directory (\fB\-\-user\-config\fR).
.Sp
This option does not disable or otherwise influence the \s-1SQL, LDAP\s0 or
Virtual Config Dir settings.
.IP "\fB\-\-auth\-ident\fR" 4
.IX Item "--auth-ident"
Verify the username provided by spamc using ident.  This is only
useful if connections are only allowed from trusted hosts (because an
identd that lies is trivial to create) and if spamc \s-1REALLY SHOULD\s0 be
running as the user it represents.  Connections are terminated
immediately if authentication fails.  In this case, spamc will pass
the mail through unchecked.  Failure to connect to an ident server,
and response timeouts are considered authentication failures.  This
requires that Net::Ident be installed.
.IP "\fB\-\-ident\-timeout\fR=\fItimeout\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ident-timeout=timeout"
Wait at most \fItimeout\fR seconds for a response to ident queries.
Authentication that takes long that \fItimeout\fR seconds will fail, and
mail will not be processed.  Setting this to 0.0 or less results in no
timeout, which is \s-1STRONGLY\s0 discouraged.  The default is 5 seconds.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR \fIhost,...\fR, \fB\-\-allowed\-ips\fR=\fIhost,...\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A host,..., --allowed-ips=host,..."
Specify a list of authorized hosts or networks which can connect to this spamd
instance. Single \s-1IP\s0 addresses can be given, ranges of \s-1IP\s0 addresses in
address/masklength \s-1CIDR\s0 format, or ranges of \s-1IP\s0 addresses by listing 3 or less
octets with a trailing dot.  Hostnames are not supported, only \s-1IP\s0 addresses.
This option can be specified multiple times, or can take a list of addresses
separated by commas.  Examples:
.Sp
\&\fB\-A 10.11.12.13\fR \*(-- only allow connections from \f(CW10.11.12.13\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-A 10.11.12.13,10.11.12.14\fR \*(-- only allow connections from \f(CW10.11.12.13\fR and
\&\f(CW10.11.12.14\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-A 10.200.300.0/24\fR \*(-- allow connections from any machine in the range
\&\f(CW\*(C`10.200.300.*\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-A 10.\fR \*(-- allow connections from any machine in the range \f(CW\*(C`10.*.*.*\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
By default, connections are only accepted from localhost [127.0.0.1].
.IP "\fB\-D\fR [\fIarea,...\fR], \fB\-\-debug\fR [\fIarea,...\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-D [area,...], --debug [area,...]"
Produce debugging output. If no areas are listed, all debugging information is
printed. Diagnostic output can also be enabled for each area individually;
\&\fIarea\fR is the area of the code to instrument. For example, to produce
diagnostic output on bayes, learn, and dns, use:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        spamassassin \-D bayes,learn,dns
.Ve
.Sp
Higher priority informational messages that are suitable for logging in normal
circumstances are available with an area of \*(L"info\*(R".
.Sp
For more information about which areas (also known as channels) are available,
please see the documentation at:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        C<http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/DebugChannels>
.Ve
.IP "\fB \-\-ipv4only\fR, \fB\-\-ipv4\-only\fR, \fB\-\-ipv4\fR" 4
.IX Item " --ipv4only, --ipv4-only, --ipv4"
Do not use IPv6 for \s-1DNS\s0 tests. Use if the existing tests
for IPv6 availability produce incorrect results or crashes.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-local\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L, --local"
Perform only local tests on all mail.  In other words, skip \s-1DNS\s0 and other
network tests.  Works the same as the \f(CW\*(C`\-L\*(C'\fR flag to \f(CWspamassassin(1)\fR.
.IP "\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paranoid\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P, --paranoid"
Die on user errors (for the user passed from spamc) instead of falling back to
user \fInobody\fR and using the default configuration.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR \fInumber\fR , \fB\-\-max\-children\fR=\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m number , --max-children=number"
This option specifies the maximum number of children to spawn.
Spamd will spawn that number of children, then sleep in the background
until a child dies, wherein it will go and spawn a new child.
.Sp
Incoming connections can still occur if all of the children are busy,
however those connections will be queued waiting for a free child.
The minimum value is \f(CW1\fR, the default value is \f(CW5\fR.
.Sp
Please note that there is a \s-1OS\s0 specific maximum of connections that can be
queued (Try \f(CW\*(C`perl \-MSocket \-e\*(Aqprint SOMAXCONN\*(Aq\*(C'\fR to find this maximum).
.Sp
Note that if you run too many servers for the amount of free \s-1RAM\s0 available, you
run the danger of hurting performance by causing a high swap load as server
processes are swapped in and out continually.
.IP "\fB\-\-min\-children\fR=\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "--min-children=number"
The minimum number of children that will be kept running.  The minimum value is
\&\f(CW1\fR, the default value is \f(CW1\fR.  If you have lots of free \s-1RAM,\s0 you may want to
increase this.
.IP "\fB\-\-min\-spare\fR=\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "--min-spare=number"
The lower limit for the number of spare children allowed to run.  A
spare, or idle, child is one that is not handling a scan request.   If
there are too few spare children available, a new server will be started
every second or so.  The default value is \f(CW1\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-max\-spare\fR=\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "--max-spare=number"
The upper limit for the number of spare children allowed to run.  If there
are too many spare children, one will be killed every second or so until
the number of idle children is in the desired range.  The default value
is \f(CW2\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-max\-conn\-per\-child\fR=\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "--max-conn-per-child=number"
This option specifies the maximum number of connections each child
should process before dying and letting the master spamd process spawn
a new child.  The minimum value is \f(CW1\fR, the default value is \f(CW200\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-round\-robin\fR" 4
.IX Item "--round-robin"
By default, \f(CW\*(C`spamd\*(C'\fR will attempt to keep a small number of \*(L"hot\*(R" child
processes as busy as possible, and keep any others as idle as possible, using
something similar to the Apache httpd server scaling algorithm.  This is
accomplished by the master process coordinating the activities of the children.
This switch will disable this scaling algorithm, and the behaviour seen in
the 3.0.x versions will be used instead, where all processes receive an
equal load and no scaling takes place.
.IP "\fB\-\-timeout\-tcp\fR=\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "--timeout-tcp=number"
This option specifies the number of seconds to wait for headers from a
client (spamc) before closing the connection.  The minimum value is \f(CW1\fR, 
the default value is \f(CW30\fR, and a value of \f(CW0\fR will disable socket
timeouts completely.
.IP "\fB\-\-timeout\-child\fR=\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "--timeout-child=number"
This option specifies the number of seconds to wait for a spamd child to
process or check a message.  The minimum value is \f(CW1\fR, the default 
value is \f(CW300\fR, and a value of \f(CW0\fR will disable child timeouts completely.
.IP "\fB\-H\fR \fIdirectory\fR, \fB\-\-helper\-home\-dir\fR=\fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-H directory, --helper-home-dir=directory"
Specify that external programs such as Razor, \s-1DCC,\s0 and Pyzor should have
a \s-1HOME\s0 environment variable set to a specific directory.  The default
is to use the \s-1HOME\s0 environment variable setting from the shell running
spamd.  By specifying no argument, spamd will use the spamc caller's
home directory instead.
.IP "\fB\-\-ssl\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ssl"
Accept only \s-1SSL\s0 connections on the associated port.
The \fBIO::Socket::SSL\fR perl module must be installed.
.Sp
If the \fB\-\-ssl\fR switch is used, and \fB\-\-ssl\-port\fR is not supplied, then
\&\fB\-\-port\fR port will be used to accept \s-1SSL\s0 connections instead of unencrypted
connections.  If the \fB\-\-ssl\fR switch is used, and \fB\-\-ssl\-port\fR is set, then
unencrypted connections will be accepted on the \fB\-\-port\fR, at the same time as
encrypted connections are accepted at \fB\-\-ssl\-port\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-ssl\-port\fR=\fIport\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ssl-port=port"
Optionally specifies the port number for the server to listen on for
\&\s-1SSL\s0 connections (default: whatever \-\-port uses).  See \fB\-\-ssl\fR for
more details.
.IP "\fB\-\-ssl\-version\fR=\fIsslversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ssl-version=sslversion"
Specify the \s-1SSL\s0 protocol version to use, one of
\&\fBsslv2\fR, \fBsslv3\fR, \fBtlsv1\fR, or \fBsslv23\fR.
The default, \fBsslv23\fR, is the most flexible, accepting a SSLv2 or higher
hello handshake, then negotiating use of SSLv3 or TLSv1 protocol if the client
can accept it.
Specifying \fB\-\-ssl\-version\fR implies \fB\-\-ssl\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-server\-key\fR \fIkeyfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--server-key keyfile"
Specify the \s-1SSL\s0 key file to use for \s-1SSL\s0 connections.
.IP "\fB\-\-server\-cert\fR \fIcertfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--server-cert certfile"
Specify the \s-1SSL\s0 certificate file to use for \s-1SSL\s0 connections.
.IP "\fB\-\-socketpath\fR \fIpathname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--socketpath pathname"
Listen on \s-1UNIX\s0 domain path \fIpathname\fR instead of a \s-1TCP\s0 socket.
.Sp
Warning: the Perl support on \s-1BSD\s0 platforms for \s-1UNIX\s0 domain sockets seems to
have a bug regarding paths of over 100 bytes or so (SpamAssassin bug 4380).  If
you see a 'could not find newly-created \s-1UNIX\s0 socket' error message, and the
path appears truncated, this may be the cause.  Try using a shorter path
to the socket.
.Sp
By default, use of \fB\-\-socketpath\fR will inhibit \s-1SSL\s0 connections and unencrypted
\&\s-1TCP\s0 connections.  To enable them, specify \fB\-\-port\fR and/or \fB\-\-ssl\-port\fR
explicitly.
.IP "\fB\-\-socketowner\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--socketowner name"
Set \s-1UNIX\s0 domain socket to be owned by the user named \fIname\fR.  Note
that this requires that spamd be started as \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR, and if \f(CW\*(C`\-u\*(C'\fR
is used, that user should have write permissions to unlink the file
later, for when the \f(CW\*(C`spamd\*(C'\fR server is killed.
.IP "\fB\-\-socketgroup\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--socketgroup name"
Set \s-1UNIX\s0 domain socket to be owned by the group named \fIname\fR.  See
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-socketowner\*(C'\fR for notes on ownership and permissions.
.IP "\fB\-\-socketmode\fR \fImode\fR" 4
.IX Item "--socketmode mode"
Set \s-1UNIX\s0 domain socket to use the octal mode \fImode\fR.  Note that if \f(CW\*(C`\-u\*(C'\fR is
used, that user should have write permissions to unlink the file later, for
when the \f(CW\*(C`spamd\*(C'\fR server is killed.
